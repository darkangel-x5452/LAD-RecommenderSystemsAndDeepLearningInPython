Recommender Systems and Deep Learning in Python by Lazy Programmer Inc.

This project is the notes taken during the course for tracking and source control.

The directory ***machine_learning_examples_internal_git*** is the original source repository provided by the course. It has it's own internal git that is linked to the original source repository so changes should not be made within that directory. This is because the instructor recommends not forking and downloading the repository, as it is other students get confused with forks/sources and the repository is often updated. 

This course is not for the faint hearted, it goes through much of theory mathematical backend and understanding and then through implementation in code. I found the course is well suited for those geared towards a mathematical and technical mindset, as the explanations have few relatable examples or real-world intuition guidance.
